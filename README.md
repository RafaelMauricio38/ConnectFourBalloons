# ConnectFourballoons
This project was made for the class of programming fundamentals in kotlin. Connect Four Ballons, based on Connect Four but with some changes, instead of starting on the bottom, we start on top, we only play against the computer and there's an option of exploding balloons, if you explode a balloon, the computer can choose one too
